and is it public ?


[01/09/2023 20:44] yash99
Fork of CompoundV2


[01/09/2023 20:44] yash99
Repo is not public


[01/09/2023 20:45] mahdi9606
do you mean is it a private contest ?


[01/09/2023 20:46] yash99
No, contest is public. Our internal repo is private. The C4 repo itself will be public once contest has started

External account and admin are EOA's?  If yes, are they manualy updating the price every epoch (~6min)?

[01/12/2023 18:22] mahdi9606
and what's the difference between forge test and yarn test-forge


[01/12/2023 18:23] mahdi9606
forge test worked for me


[01/12/2023 18:23] tom2o17#1279
Yes EOA/msig will update price w/n cashManager, Epoch is set to 1 day for cash plz see L154 in `forge-tests/cash/BasicDeployment.sol`


[01/12/2023 18:26] tom2o17#1279
`yarn test-forge` runs a script in package.json.

` "test-forge": "forge test --fork-url $(grep -w FORGE_API_KEY_ETHEREUM .env | cut -d '=' -f2) --fork-block-number $(grep -w FORK_FROM_BLOCK_NUMBER .env | cut -d '=' -f2)",`

[01/12/2023 18:26] tom2o17#1279
You will need to specify the API key w/n the `.env` to run w/ `yarn test-forge`


[01/12/2023 18:27] tom2o17#1279
Good luck!

Hey got a question @tom2o17 🌊 . How will the MANAGER_ADMIN get all the info to execute transaction correctly? For example how does he know which users want redeem and which refund of their tokens and which users he has to include in completeRedemptions call in the first place?


[01/13/2023 17:17] Cameron Clifton#0336
Hi Nalus, 
For redemptions, the manager admin will have access to off chain accounting systems for calculating the correct exchange rate of CASH->USDC for redemptions.

For determining who to include in the `completeRedemptions` call, the manager admin can look at all the withdrawal requests and their respective quantities in the `redemptionInfoPerEpoch` mapping  in CashManager.sol.  

As for refunds, we imagine this case will be really rare, but we have added the ability to simply refund someone the amount of CASH token they “requested redemption” for for any unforeseen situations where there is some legal reason we are unable to grant the redemption request at that time. 

Does that help answer your question?

Hi the epoch duration can be set by an account with the MANAGER_ADMIN role.

Is there a specific reason why the assetSender is used? Why not just transfer it back from the assetRecipient?


[01/15/2023 19:33] horsefacts
There's a reference to `"fETH"` here in the `CompoundLens` contract, but as far as I can tell, there's no Ondo equivalent of Compound `CEther`, is that right?

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-ondo/blob/f3426e5b6b4561e09460b2e6471eb694efdd6c70/contracts/lending/CompoundLens.sol#L53


[01/15/2023 19:57] tom2o17#1279
This was done to allow for the possibility of using two different addresses for assets, one to handle outbound and one for handling inbound assets.


[01/15/2023 19:57] tom2o17#1279
Currently there is no ondo equivalent of `CEther`, but it might be something we create/support down the line.

[01/15/2023 21:23] CharlesPal#0309
Okay and you’re going to transfer assets between these two internally?


[01/15/2023 21:56] tom2o17#1279
Yes, Flow of `collateral`/underlying will be:
minting: `user` --> `AssetRecipient`  --> Brokerage 
redemption: Brokerage --> `AssetSender` --> `user`

Hey just wanted to push a PSA since I have been getting a fair amount of questions re if `completeWithdrawal` can be called more than once w/n an epoch. 

The short answer is yes it can be called multiple times per epoch. 

This [splitting up the calls] should be done if the gas consumed would be gt the block gas limit [~ 150 users `requestingRedemptions` w/n an epoch]. The Flow for this would look similar to the image attached.
